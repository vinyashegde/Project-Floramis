[Floramis](https://www.floramis.com/) is a Singapore-based startup which is building an ecosystem of plants linked with tech to create engaging experiences which drive changes in consumer behaviour towards increased sustainability.

By turning plants into virtual pets and leveraging on the underutilized ubiquity of plants, we are developing a deeper emotional bond between users and their environment, incentivising them to care more deeply about it and to take tangible steps towards saving it.

Being a predominantly Gen-Z team and a startup to boot, we at Floramis fully embrace a culture where each member of our team feels ownership over their work and can see the tangible impact of their work everyday. As a small team of ~10 members, you would get to work directly with the co-founders of Floramis and will have the opportunity to create a sizeable impact on the world through our endeavour. 

Furthermore, the work you do during your Octernship would always be within the realm of our core product and would always end up in the hands of our users. Beyond experiencing the engineering side of Floramis, you will also have the opportunity to gain exposure to the ins and outs of entrepreneurship & running a startup, marketing & sales and even art & design. 

If all of this excites you, we would love to have you join us at Floramis!

# Assignment
## Isometric Garden Scene in Unity for Mobile Devices

### Task instructions
Build a scene in Unity targeted at mobile devices which allows a user to maintain a garden of their favourite plants. The scene should have the following features:
1. An isometric garden presented as a grid where a user can tap anywhere to add a plant
2. The plant should be represented by some 3D object
3. The scene should be zoomable and pannable via pinch and other touch controls
4. Tapping on an empty spot on the grid would open a popup allowing the user to search for a plant and add it to their garden.
5. The popup should interface with a REST API to to pull data about a searched plant and preview it.
6. Back in the isometric grid view, the user should be able to tap on a previously added plant to open a popup containing information about it.

For reference, the above features are also presented via the mockup below to get you started on the design side. However, you are encouraged to add your own flair to the design or extra features which might improve the user experience and usability of this scene.

</p>

### Task requirements
- The task should be completed on your own
- Must use Unity with either the `iOS` or `Android` platform selected. The app does not need to be tested on a phone, and will only need to be ran in the game view within the Unity editor
- Your UI must be able to scale across different resolutions and aspect ratios (these will be adjusted in the scene view)
- Must use at least 1 REST API to search for and pull plant data
- You are allowed to use code and assets from other sources, but **you must add a reference to them in your submission**

### Task expectations
Here is an outline of what we are looking for through this task.
- Cleanliness and maintainability of code. At Floramis your code would most definitely be used by someone else, so it must be readable and maintable by others.
- Ability to design neat UI and UX (doesn't have to be **AMAZING**, but just something that has some thought in usability and aesthetics)
- Ability to use REST APIs to pull data from the web and display it in the UI without much lag or stuttering
- Resourcefulness in finding materials online which can speed up your development and/or improve the desired features

### Task submission

Students are expected to use the [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) when working on their task. This includes
1. Creating a new branch
2. Making changes on the new branch to complete the task
3. Opening a Pull Request for review
