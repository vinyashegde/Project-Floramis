# Project Floramis

This is a mobile game scene in Unity where the user maintains a garden of plants on a grid. The garden is isometric and the user can tap anywhere to add a plant. The scene is zoomable and pannable via touch controls. Tapping on an empty spot brings up a popup to search for and add a plant via a REST API. Tapping on a previously added plant opens a popup with information about it.

## Isometric Garden Scene in Unity for Mobile Devices

### Task instructions
Build a scene in Unity targeted at mobile devices which allows a user to maintain a garden of their favourite plants. The scene should have the following features:
1. An isometric garden presented as a grid where a user can tap anywhere to add a plant
2. The plant should be represented by some 3D object
3. The scene should be zoomable and pannable via pinch and other touch controls
4. Tapping on an empty spot on the grid would open a popup allowing the user to search for a plant and add it to their garden.
5. The popup should interface with a REST API to to pull data about a searched plant and preview it.
6. Back in the isometric grid view, the user should be able to tap on a previously added plant to open a popup containing information about it.
